# FSD_Nano-Project
This is a Full Stack Nano-Project utilizing HTML5, CSS, Client-Side JavaScript and Node.js technologies where the users can share files with each other
A File Sharing Website where the user can upload file and share files by either the auto-generated link or by directly sending it over the email address of the receiver.
The Back-End of the project was handled by me (Chayan Vats) which is mainly in Node js and the Front-End of the project was made by my team-mates (HTML by Anant Singh, CSS by Rohan Kauts and Javascript by Amitesh Singh)
